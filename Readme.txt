Dear Barry,

- I have tested the code and all brackets are working. There was a problem in my git commits so, I had to re-commit them.
- When the gallery object added you will need to click the gallery name to go the image page.
- For executing the project. : dev_appserver.py --clear_datastore true app.yaml
can be used.
Thanks,

Erdogan Berke Kocar
